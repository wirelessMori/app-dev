### My all time favorite genres for movies/series has always been a variety of Animation, Sci-Fi, and Adventure. Such as:
*Wall-E(2008)*, 
*Steven Universe(2013-2019)*, its sequel movie, and its sequel series *Steven Universe: Future(2019-2020)*, 
*Star Wars(until Episode VI, 1983)*, 
*How to train your dragon(2010 & 2014)*, 
*Kung Fu Panda(2008, 2011, 2016)*, 
*Shrek(2001, 2004, 2007, 2010)*, etc. 
As well as some old Barbie movie classics like *Magic of Pegasus, Diamond Castle, Princess and the Pauper*, and more.
